# Fitness Plan Maker - Implementation

## Product Goal
Build a single-page web app that collects fitness intake data and generates a workout plan. Users can create, read, update, and delete plans locally while AI integration is pending.

## Current Architecture
- Frontend: React (Create React App, JavaScript)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (CLI build pipeline)
- Persistence: `localStorage` via `src/services/planStorage.js`
- Plan generation: deterministic local mock in `src/services/planGenerator.js`

## Data Model
### Intake model
- `height`: `{ value: number, unit: "in" | "cm" }`
- `weight`: `{ value: number, unit: "lb" | "kg" }`
- `goal`: `"build_muscle" | "lose_weight" | "endurance" | "general_fitness"`
- `daysPerWeek`: `1..7`
- `workoutLocation`: `"home" | "gym"`
- `homeEquipment`: `{ pullUpBar: boolean, dipStation: boolean }`

### Plan model
- `id`: string
- `createdAt`: ISO timestamp
- `input`: intake snapshot
- `title`: string
- `days`: `Array<{ day: string, focus: string, exercises: string[] }>`
- `notes`: string

## Validation Rules
- Height and weight must be numeric and positive.
- Goal is required.
- `daysPerWeek` must be an integer from 1 to 7.
- Workout location is required.
- Home equipment defaults to false/false when non-home flow is used.

## Current User Flow
1. User fills intake form.
2. If location is Home, pull-up bar and dip station toggles are shown.
3. User clicks Generate Plan.
4. Plan is generated by local mock service and saved to localStorage.
5. User can edit plan title/notes inline and delete plans.

## Known Limitations
- AI generation is not integrated yet.
- No backend or authentication.
- No unit conversion; selected unit and value are stored as entered.
- No export/share flow yet.

## Milestones
1. Add AI agent integration endpoint and prompt contract.
2. Add server-side persistence and user accounts.
3. Add plan history/versioning and regenerate flow.
4. Add nutrition and progressive overload options.
